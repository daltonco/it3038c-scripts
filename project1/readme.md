The script I am writing for Project 1 will do the following:
- It will report back system information. This includes hostname, device specs,and Mac addresses.
- It will initiate Windows updates.

These are tasks and information that we commonly need on computers at my job. I work help desk and we whenever we touch a computer we need to ensure we have all of the correct spec info in our asset management system, and we always check for updates for vulnerability patching.
