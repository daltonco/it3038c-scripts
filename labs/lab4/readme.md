This is the readme.md for lab 4 that I was not required to make but i did anyway bc I needed to add some additional content for the sake of adding content to push to github does this count as a run on sentence wow look at this what an incredible stream of consciousness we're getting here from the brilliant mind of colton dalotn is this what insanity feels like where you just talk to yourself and to everybody else it seems normal but in my reality im furiously typing at my desk to myself lol my gf probably thinks im writing some incredible badass program rn lmao bye
